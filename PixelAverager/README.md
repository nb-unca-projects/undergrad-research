How to Use this Program
=======================

###### In a command prompt:
    cd to the project directory
    java -jar path/to/PixelAverager.jar [imagefile1] [imagefile2] [imageOutputfile]

#### Current Issues
* The averaged files come out more red than they should be
  * Raw rgba average has been ruled out, possibly a read/write error?
